```

**🐛 Monaco Editor Not Loading**:
```
❌ "Content Security Policy violation"  
✅ Fixed: Updated CSP headers to allow CDN resources
```

**🐛 AI Not Responding**:
```
❌ Check your API keys in environment variables
✅ Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY are set
```

### **Performance Issues**
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Verify API rate limits aren't exceeded
