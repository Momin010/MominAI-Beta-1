## Conclusion

The MominAI system demonstrates strong core functionality with excellent performance metrics. The free user workflow is well-implemented and the system handles concurrent users effectively. However, security hardening and API consistency are critical areas that require immediate attention before production deployment.

**Recommendation:** Address the high-priority security and API issues before proceeding with production deployment. The performance foundation is solid and can support the expected user load once security concerns are resolved.
