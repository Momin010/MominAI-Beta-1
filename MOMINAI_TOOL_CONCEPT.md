# MominAI-Tool: The Multi-Model AI Scratchpad - A Conceptual Deep Dive

## PART 1: THE CORE PROBLEM & THE STRATEGIC VISION

### 1.1 The Fragmented Landscape of AI-Assisted Development

In the current generative AI boom, developers, researchers, and creators find themselves in a paradoxical position. They have unprecedented access to a multitude of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs)—from OpenAI's GPT series to Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini—each with unique strengths, weaknesses, and "personalities." However, this abundance of choice has introduced a significant and often unspoken workflow bottleneck: **the context-switching tax**.

The modern AI-native developer's workflow is a disjointed and inefficient process:

1.  **The Idea:** A developer has a complex task, such as creating a robust database schema, writing a multi-threaded networking script, or refactoring a legacy piece of code.
2.  **The First Attempt:** They open a browser tab and navigate to their preferred AI interface, like ChatGPT. They carefully craft a detailed prompt, paste in code context, and wait for the response.
3.  **The Second Opinion:** The generated output might be good, but is it the *best*? To find out, they open a second tab for Claude, a third for Gemini, and perhaps a fourth for a specialized open-source model.
4.  **The Manual Labor:** They must copy the original prompt and paste it into each interface. If the prompt needs refinement, this process is repeated across all tabs.
5.  **The Comparison Nightmare:** The developer is now faced with multiple browser tabs, each containing a wall of text or code. They are forced to manually scan, visually compare, and mentally diff the outputs. This process is slow, prone to error, and fundamentally breaks the cognitive flow of development. It turns a creative task into a clerical one.

This fragmentation leads to several critical problems:
- **Cognitive Overload:** Juggling multiple interfaces and outputs drains mental energy that should be spent on the core problem.
- **Broken Flow State:** The constant context switching makes it impossible to enter the deep focus "flow state" essential for high-quality software development.
- **Inefficient Iteration:** Refining a prompt and seeing how it affects the output of different models is a tedious, manual loop.
- **Lost Insights:** Without a unified view, subtle but important differences in logic, style, or efficiency between model outputs can be easily missed.

The current paradigm forces the developer to act as a human router, manually shuttling information between services. The tools are powerful, but the workflow is broken.

### 1.2 The Vision: A Unified Canvas for AI Collaboration

The MominAI-Tool, The Multi-Model AI Scratchpad, is conceived as the definitive solution to this fragmentation. It is not another AI chat interface. It is a purpose-built development environment designed around a single, powerful premise: **what if a developer could collaborate with all major AI models simultaneously, in a single, fluid interface?**

Our vision is to transform the developer's interaction with AI from a series of disjointed queries into a unified, real-time brainstorming session. The Scratchpad is a canvas where the developer's prompt is the central artifact, and the AI models act as a team of expert collaborators, each offering their unique perspective in parallel.

The core principles of this vision are:

- **Unification:** Bring all major models (starting with Gemini, Claude, and OpenAI's GPT) into one interface. The developer deals with one input and one consolidated output view.
- **Simultaneity:** Requests are sent to all configured models at the same time. Outputs are streamed back in parallel, providing instant, real-time feedback.
- **Comparability:** The user interface is designed from the ground up to make comparing outputs effortless. Through intelligent diffing, semantic analysis, and side-by-side views, the developer can move from raw output to actionable insight in seconds.
- **Developer-Centricity:** This is a tool for professionals. It means a high-fidelity code editor for prompts, keyboard-centric workflows, and absolute control over model parameters.
- **Trust and Privacy:** The tool operates on a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) model. User API keys are stored exclusively in the browser's local storage and are never transmitted to any MominAI server. All AI interactions happen directly between the user's browser and the AI provider, ensuring maximum privacy and security.

The MominAI Scratchpad will be to AI-assisted development what a multi-track audio editor is to music production. It allows the creator to isolate, compare, and synthesize the best parts of multiple inputs to produce a superior final product. It aims to eliminate the workflow friction, restore the creative flow, and unlock the true potential of having a team of AI experts at your fingertips.

### 1.3 Target Audience: The AI-Native Developer & The Prompt Engineer

The primary user for the MominAI Scratchpad is the **AI-Native Developer**. This is not a beginner learning to code, but a professional who already understands software development and now treats LLMs as a fundamental part of their toolkit.

This persona includes:

- **Prompt Engineers:** Professionals whose primary job is to design, test, and refine prompts for various applications. For them, the Scratchpad is the ultimate workbench, allowing for rapid A/B/C testing of prompts across different models to find the optimal combination of clarity, conciseness, and performance.
- **AI Application Developers:** Developers building applications on top of LLM APIs. They use the Scratchpad to prototype and debug the core prompts that will power their applications. They can quickly determine which model is best suited (and most cost-effective) for a specific feature, be it data extraction, summarization, or code generation.
- **Senior Developers & Architects:** When faced with complex design decisions (e.g., choosing a database technology, designing a microservices architecture), they use the Scratchpad to poll multiple AIs for architectural patterns, pros and cons, and boilerplate code, synthesizing the results into a well-informed decision.
- **Researchers and Academics:** Individuals studying the behavior, biases, and capabilities of different LLMs. The Scratchpad provides a powerful, repeatable way to conduct experiments by sending the same prompt to multiple models and analyzing the nuanced differences in their responses.
- **Content Creators & Technical Writers:** Those who create technical documentation or tutorials can use the tool to generate and refine code examples, ensuring they are clear, correct, and idiomatic by comparing the outputs of several "expert" AIs.

The common thread is a desire for efficiency, precision, and a deeper level of interaction with AI models. They are "power users" who are currently underserved by generic, single-model chat interfaces. The MominAI Scratchpad is designed to be their essential, everyday tool.

## PART 2: THE CORE USER EXPERIENCE & UI/UX DEEP DIVE

The design philosophy of the MominAI Scratchpad is rooted in minimalism, speed, and information density. The interface must provide immense power without becoming cluttered or complex. The core layout is a **Triptych**: a three-part structure that guides the user's focus and workflow naturally.

### 2.1 The Triptych Layout: Prompt, Outputs, and Analysis

The screen is divided into three primary zones:

**1. The Prompt Canvas (Left Panel):**
This is the developer's cockpit, the single source of truth for their query. It is not a simple `<textarea>`. It is a full-featured instance of the **Monaco Editor**, the same editor that powers VS Code.

- **High-Fidelity Editing:** Users get everything they expect from a modern code editor: syntax highlighting (for multiple languages, including Markdown with code blocks), bracket matching, indentation guides, and undo/redo history.
- **Prompt Versioning:** Every time a prompt is run, its text and configuration are saved to the browser's `localStorage`. A simple dropdown allows the user to instantly revert to previous versions of their prompt, making iteration and experimentation painless.
- **Templates:** Users can save frequently used prompts (e.g., "Act as a senior Go developer. Review the following code for performance bottlenecks and concurrency issues...") as templates, allowing them to bootstrap new sessions quickly.
- **Context Area:** A separate, smaller editor pane within the canvas allows users to paste in large blocks of "context" code or text that will be prepended to the prompt, keeping the main prompt area clean and focused on the specific instruction.

**2. The Output Arena (Center/Main View):**
This is the stage where the AI models perform. It consists of a set of resizable, side-by-side panels.

- **One Panel Per Model:** Each configured AI model (e.g., "OpenAI GPT-4o", "Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet", "Google Gemini 1.5 Flash") gets its own dedicated panel.
- **Real-Time Streaming:** As the models generate their responses, the text streams into their respective panels in real-time. This is critical for user experience, as it provides immediate feedback and avoids the perception of a "frozen" application. Each panel has its own loading spinner that disappears once its stream is complete.
- **Rich Output Rendering:** The output is not rendered as plain text. It is parsed and rendered as rich content. Markdown is formatted, and code blocks are syntax-highlighted using a library like Prism.js or similar. Each code block has a "Copy" button.
- **Per-Model Controls:** Each panel's header displays the model name, the generation time, and the token count (prompt + completion). It also contains controls to re-run the generation for just that model or to remove the panel from the view.

**3. The Analysis & Control Panel (Right Panel or Global Top Bar):**
This is the global command center for the application.

- **Global Model Configuration:** A primary "Run" or "Generate" button (`Ctrl+Enter` is the keyboard shortcut). Next to it, a settings cog opens a modal for global configuration.
- **API Key Management:** The settings modal is where users manage their API keys. A clear and prominent notice explains the BYOK model and the local-only storage of keys.
- **Parameter Tuning:** Users can set global parameters like `temperature` and `max tokens` that apply to all models, or they can switch to a "Per-Model" tab to override these settings for each AI individually. This allows for powerful experiments, like setting one model to be highly creative (high temperature) and another to be highly deterministic (low temperature).
- **The Diff Controller:** This is the most important part of the analysis panel. A set of controls allows the user to manipulate how the outputs are compared.

### 2.2 The "Intelligent Diffing" Engine: The Core Innovation

The true power of the Scratchpad lies in its ability to go beyond simple side-by-side viewing. The "Intelligent Diffing" engine is what turns raw information into actionable insight.

- **Activation:** As soon as at least two models have finished generating, the diffing engine runs automatically. The user can select a "base" model for comparison (e.g., "Compare everything to Claude's output"), and the other panels will be highlighted relative to this base.
- **Semantic Highlighting:** This is far more than a standard `git diff`.
    - **Text Diff:** For prose, it uses a library like `diff-match-patch` to highlight character, word, or line-level differences. Insertions are highlighted in green, deletions in red.
    - **Code Diff (AST-based):** For code, the engine attempts to parse the outputs into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). This allows for a much more intelligent "semantic diff." For example, if one model uses a `for` loop and another uses a `map` function to achieve the same result, the diff engine can highlight both blocks and label them as "Structural Variant: Iteration." If one model correctly includes error handling and another doesn't, the missing `try...catch` block is highlighted as a "Missing Logic: Error Handling."
- **Diff Modes:** The user can toggle between different views:
    - **"Inline Diff":** Shows additions and deletions within a single, merged text block.
    - **"Side-by-Side Diff":** The default view, showing differences across the panels.
- **The "Synthesize" Feature (Experimental):** This is an advanced feature where the tool uses a "meta" AI call. It takes the prompt and all the generated outputs, and sends them back to a powerful model (like GPT-4o) with a final instruction: "You are a senior software architect. Based on the user's prompt and the following attempts from several AI assistants, synthesize the best possible single response. Combine the strengths of each, eliminate their weaknesses, and produce the optimal, most robust, and most efficient solution." The result is displayed in a new, primary "Synthesized" panel.

## PART 3: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE & IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

The architecture must be simple, robust, and focused on delivering a fast, client-side experience. The BYOK model is the key constraint, dictating a client-heavy architecture.

### 3.1 Frontend Stack & Justification

- **Framework:** **React 18**. Chosen for its mature ecosystem, component-based architecture, and strong community support. Its hooks-based model (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`) is perfectly suited for managing the state of a single-page application like this.
- **Build Tool:** **Vite**. Chosen for its near-instantaneous Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and fast build times. For a tool designed for rapid iteration, a fast development server is non-negotiable.
- **Language:** **TypeScript**. Chosen for its type safety, which is critical for managing the complex data structures of AI API responses and for building a maintainable, long-term project.
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**. Chosen for its utility-first approach, which allows for rapid UI development without writing custom CSS. It helps maintain a consistent design system and is highly performant.

### 3.2 The AI Service Abstraction Layer

This is the most critical piece of business logic in the application, likely encapsulated in a file like `src/lib/ai-service.ts`. Its purpose is to provide a single, consistent interface for interacting with the disparate AI models.

- **The Unified Interface:** It will expose a primary function, e.g.:
  ```typescript
  interface AIResponse {
    modelName: string;
    outputStream: ReadableStream<string>;
    // Promise that resolves with final token counts, etc.
    metadata: Promise<{ promptTokens: number; completionTokens: number; }>;
  }

  function generateFromAll(
    prompt: string,
    context: string,
    configs: Map<string, ModelConfig>
  ): AIResponse[]
  ```
- **Provider-Specific Clients:** Internally, this service will contain separate modules for each AI provider.
    - `openai.ts`: Uses the `openai` npm package. It will contain a function that takes the generic `ModelConfig` and translates it into the specific format required by the OpenAI API, then makes the call and returns the response stream.
    - `anthropic.ts`: Uses the `@anthropic-ai/sdk` package and does the same translation for the Claude API.
    - `google.ts`: Uses the `@google/generative-ai` package for Gemini.
- **Stream Handling:** A key responsibility of this layer is to normalize the response streams. Each provider's SDK returns a slightly different stream format. The service will wrap these in a standard `ReadableStream` that the UI can consume without needing to know which provider it came from.
- **Error Handling:** The service will implement robust error handling, catching API errors (e.g., invalid key, rate limit exceeded, content moderation) and forwarding them to the UI in a structured format so they can be displayed gracefully in the corresponding model's output panel.

### 3.3 State Management

For this focused tool, a complex state management library like Redux or even Zustand is likely overkill. The state can be managed effectively using React's built-in hooks.

- **`App.tsx` as the State Owner:** The main application component will own the primary state.
  ```typescript
  const [prompt, setPrompt] = useState<string>('');
  const [context, setContext] = useState<string>('');
  const [apiKeys, setApiKeys] = useLocalStorageState<ApiKeys>('mominai-keys', {});
  const [modelConfigs, setModelConfigs] = useState<Map<string, ModelConfig>>(...);
  const [generationResults, setGenerationResults] = useState<Map<string, GenerationResult>>(...);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
  ```
- **`useLocalStorageState`:** A simple custom hook will be used to persist API keys and user preferences (like selected theme, default parameters) to `localStorage`.
- **Passing State:** State and dispatch functions (`setPrompt`, etc.) will be passed down to child components (Editor, OutputPanel) via props. For a deeper component tree, `React.useContext` could be used to provide state to avoid prop-drilling.

### 3.4 Backend & Data Persistence

In the primary BYOK model, **there is no backend server**. This is a strategic choice that maximizes user privacy and minimizes operational complexity and cost.

- **API Calls:** All calls to AI providers are made directly from the user's browser to the provider's public API endpoint. This is possible because the user is providing their own API key, which authenticates them.
- **CORS:** All major AI providers configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on their API endpoints to allow direct calls from web applications.
- **Data Persistence:** All user data (prompts, history, API keys) is stored in the browser's `localStorage`. This means the user's entire workspace is contained within their browser on their machine. The downside is that the workspace is not portable across devices, which is a trade-off made for simplicity and privacy.

### 3.5 The Diffing Implementation

The diffing logic will live in `src/utils/diff.ts`.

- **Library:** It will be built on top of a proven library like `diff-match-patch`.
- **The Diff Function:**
  ```typescript
  function computeDiff(baseText: string, compareText: string): Diff[] {
    const dmp = new diff_match_patch();
    const diffs = dmp.diff_main(baseText, compareText);
    dmp.diff_cleanupSemantic(diffs);
    return diffs;
  }
  ```
- **Rendering the Diff:** The React component for the output panel will receive the diff result. It will map over the array of diffs and render the text in different `<span>` elements with appropriate classes for styling.
  ```jsx
  // Simplified example
  diff.map(([op, text], index) => {
    if (op === DIFF_INSERT) {
      return <span key={index} className="bg-green-200">{text}</span>;
    } else if (op === DIFF_DELETE) {
      // In a side-by-side view, you might render this with a strike-through
      // or simply omit it from the 'compare' panel.
      return <span key={index} className="bg-red-200 line-through">{text}</span>;
    } else { // DIFF_EQUAL
      return <span key={index}>{text}</span>;
    }
  });
  ```
- **AST-based Diffing (Advanced):** For the more advanced semantic diffing, the implementation would involve using a JavaScript parser like Acorn or Babel to parse the code into an AST. The diffing logic would then compare the two ASTs, identifying differences in node types, structures, and content. This is a significantly more complex task and would likely be a post-MVP feature.

## PART 4: FUTURE VISION & POTENTIAL EXPANSION

The initial version of the MominAI Scratchpad is a focused, powerful tool. But its architecture allows for significant future expansion, transforming it from a tool into a platform.

### 4.1 Prompt Chaining and Conversational History

The current model is "one prompt, multiple outputs." The next logical step is to support conversational context.

- **Implementation:** The UI would be modified to show a history of prompt/response pairs. When the user sends a new prompt, a toggle would allow them to include the context of the previous turn in the API call. The `ai-service` would be updated to handle the message history format required by the AI providers' chat completion endpoints.

### 4.2 Shareable Scratchpads

One of the biggest limitations of the client-only model is the inability to share work.

- **Implementation:** This would require a simple backend and database (a perfect use case for a service like Supabase or Firebase).
    1.  A "Share" button would capture the current state (prompt, context, model outputs, configurations).
    2.  This state would be saved as a JSON object to a database, generating a unique ID.
    3.  The application would be able to load a session from a URL like `momin.ai/scratchpad/<session_id>`. The app would fetch the JSON from the database and hydrate the UI with the saved state.

### 4.3 Custom & Local Model Integration

Power users often run their own local models using tools like Ollama or LM Studio.

- **Implementation:** The settings panel would be expanded to include a "Custom Models" section. Users could define a new model by providing a name and an API endpoint URL. The `ai-service` would be updated with a generic client that can make a `POST` request to any user-defined endpoint, assuming it conforms to a standard API contract (like OpenAI's).

### 4.4 Cost & Token Analysis Dashboard

As users become more reliant on the tool, they will need to manage their API costs.

- **Implementation:** The metadata returned from each AI call (token counts) would be stored in `localStorage`. A new "Usage" tab or modal would display a dashboard showing:
    - Total tokens used per model over time.
    - Estimated cost per model (based on user-inputted pricing).
    - A breakdown of the most "expensive" prompts.

### 4.5 From Scratchpad to a Lightweight IDE

Once the core comparative engine is perfected, it can become the foundation for a more complete development environment. The features that were initially cut could be gradually and thoughtfully re-introduced as optional plugins or panels.

- **File System Access:** Using the File System Access API to allow the Scratchpad to read from and write to local files, turning it into a true local editor.
- **Integrated Terminal:** Adding an Xterm.js panel for running commands.
- **The Ultimate Goal:** To evolve into a new kind of IDE, where AI is not a bolted-on assistant but the central, collaborative core of the entire development process. The comparative workflow of the Scratchpad would be integrated into every aspect of the IDE, from writing code to reviewing pull requests and debugging errors.
