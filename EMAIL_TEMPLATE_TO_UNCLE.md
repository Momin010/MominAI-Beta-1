Assalamu Alaikum Ja Amu Imad,

I hope this email finds you in the best of health and spirits! I really appreciate you offering to help with hosting MominAI on your server.

As we discussed, I have the landing page already live on Vercel at:
https://momin-ai-landing-page.vercel.app/

Now I need your help to deploy the main IDE platform. Here's what we need to do:

## ðŸŽ¯ **What We're Building**
MominAI is an AI-powered development platform where users can:
- Create websites and apps in seconds using AI
- Get private, secure coding workspaces
- Test and run their projects safely
- Collaborate without affecting each other

Each user gets their own isolated Docker container for security.

## ðŸ“‹ **What I Need From You**

### **Server Access Details:**
- Your server IP address: _______________
- SSH access method: [ ] Password / [ ] Key-based
- Your preferred time for setup: _______________
- Any specific server restrictions I should know about?

### **Server Requirements Check:**
Please confirm your Ubuntu server has:
- âœ… Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- âœ… At least 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
- âœ… 10GB free disk space
- âœ… Internet connection
- âœ… Root or sudo access

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Steps (I'll Guide You Through Each One)**

I've created a complete step-by-step guide that we'll follow together:

### **Phase 1: Server Preparation (15 minutes)**
- Install Docker and Docker Compose
- Install nginx for web serving
- Set up basic security (firewall)

### **Phase 2: Deploy MominAI Backend (20 minutes)**
- Download the project files
- Configure environment settings
- Start the Docker containers
- Test the deployment

### **Phase 3: Domain & SSL Setup (15 minutes)**
- Point dev.mominai.com to your server
- Set up SSL certificates
- Configure nginx reverse proxy

## ðŸ“… **Timeline**
- **Total Time**: 45-60 minutes
- **When**: [Your preferred time/date]
- **Communication**: I'll be available on [WhatsApp/Phone/Email]

## ðŸ”§ **What I'll Provide**
- âœ… Complete deployment guide with copy-paste commands
- âœ… All necessary configuration files
- âœ… Step-by-step troubleshooting
- âœ… Real-time support during deployment
- âœ… Backup and maintenance instructions

## ðŸ’° **Cost**
- **Your Server**: Whatever you're already paying
- **Additional**: ~$0 (using free tiers for everything)
- **Future Scaling**: We can discuss AWS when the beta is successful

## ðŸ“ž **Next Steps**
1. Reply with your server details above
2. Let me know your availability
3. I'll send you the detailed guide
4. We'll do the deployment together

This will be a great learning experience for both of us, and I'm excited to see MominAI running on a proper server!

Thank you so much for your support and generosity. I really appreciate you taking the time to help me with this.

With my salaams to the entire family,
